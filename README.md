.../lua -- All what I needed for gamemode.
.../gamemode/terrortown -- Source code.

== Description ==
After the GMod 13 switchover, everything was broken. 
I made really cool TTT server with original and perfect weaponry for everyone.
Since my Trouble Terrorist Town gamemode starts being laggy and not so optimized.
I`ve resolved to remake this gamemode from 'Zero' to the Best of Russian Server.
Did I succeed or fail? The answer is up to me. 

== Credits ==
